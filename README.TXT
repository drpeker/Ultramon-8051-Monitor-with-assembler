	UltraMON51 is a first-class monitor program with 
features rivaling those of the expensive 8031 hardware 
ICE and PC based software emulators, while offering 
some unique features not commonly available in those 
products.  If you are putting together or customizing 
your own 8031 based single board 
computer ("SBC"), UltraMON51 will prove valuable in 
the troubleshooting of the hardware in your system.  
If you are just learning 8031 assembly language, 
UltraMON51 is tremendously valuable as an educational 
real-time tutor.  Should you be an experienced 8031 
programmer, UltraMON51 can assist in the debugging of 
your tricky software algorithms, or help out with the 
deciphering of someone else's object code.  In short, 
you'll wonder how you ever got along without it! 
 
	Some of the more interesting features of 
UltraMON51 include XMODEM-CRC data transfers to and 
from program ROM and external RAM which allows for 
generic data to be transferred without pre-formatting 
into any specific arrangement such as Intel Hex, 
Motorola Hex, etc.  The data can be ASCII text, data 
tables, or executable object files which opens up the 
possibility of EPROMless code development.  Also 
included is a line oriented semi-symbolic assembler 
and dissembler, perfect for writing and modifying code 
on the fly, or learning the oddball 8031 instruction 
set.  The single-step execute mode includes the 
relevant instruction disassembly with SFR/register 
dumps tremendously simplifying the elimination of 
those elusive programming bugs. 
 
-----------------------------------------------------
	I have sold this product commercially for 
several years now but recently decided to place 
UltraMON51 in the public domain.  You are hearby 
authorized to freely distribute/modify/improve this 
program any way you see fit (except for profit by 
selling it directly), but I will not be held 
responsible for any damage you cause in any 
way/shape/form by using UltraMON51. 
 
	Included in the archive are the following files: 
	 
	README.TXT		:  you're reading it right now 
	ULTRAMON.HEX	:  Intel HEX file of 
executable 
	ULTRAMON.BIN	:  Binary image of executable 
	ULTRAMON.PS	:  Postscript file of documentation 
	ULTRAMON.DOC	:  MS Word 6.0 documentation 
 
	The documentation just doesn't translate to a 
text file very well at all, so I hope this doesn't 
cause you any problems with printing the doc's.  To 
print the .PS documentation here's a good procedure: 
 
	1.  make sure the printer is postscript capable 
	2.  verify the printer is set to a very high 
timeout setting (infinite works best) 
	3.  make sure DOS is also set to a high timeout.  
Try this: 
		MODE LPTx: RETRY=P 
	4.  type COPY /B ULTRAMON.PS LPTx: 
 
	You could also view the documentation with the 
'ghostscript' program available at many sites 
around the internet and local BBS's. 
 
	There is a fairly large graphic about halfway 
thru the printing which spools for a while so don't 
be alarmed.
